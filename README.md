# dcs-react-router-sync

An NPM package to synchronize the React Router with the
[Docuss](https://github.com/sylque/docuss) plugin.

**This project is not active anymore.** Fixes are provided to existing users, but I stopped working on new features. You might want to check  [DiscPage](https://github.com/sylque/discpage), which is somehow a simplified version of Docuss.

## Setup

Install with:

```
npm i dcs-react-router-sync
```

## How to use
